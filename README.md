# mod_github_profile

A very simple implementation of a Joomla 3.x module.

## Somewhat Important

Rename `includes/sample.github.php` to `includes/github.php` and fill in your deets if you want to - this particular API is accessible without authentication but is rate limited.

## Just FYI...

This sample code was created for use on [http://learn.wearefree.ca](http://learn.wearefree.ca/standard/joomla-module/).  It was written for training purposes only and should not be used in production environments without the required customizations (noted above).
